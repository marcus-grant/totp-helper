TOTP Helper
===========

A cli script to help manage generating, encoding, and decoding TOTP (Timed One-Time Passwords).

Note
----

- The `hello.txt.gpg` file is encrypted using code '123' and should display `Hello world!` when decrypted
    - It's just there to test the GPG functionality of the helper utilities
